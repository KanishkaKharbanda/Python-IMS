The inventory tracker project is developed using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and SQLite Browser for database management. The program features a login system with a password recovery option, allowing users to reset their password if forgotten. Upon successful login, users are directed to a dashboard that provides access to various sections of the application, including employee details, grocery inventory, supplier information, and bill creation. This tool aims to streamline inventory management by organizing and tracking essential data in an efficient and user-friendly manner.
